# AI-Virtual-Mouse


This project uses MediaPipe framework for Hand Landmark Detection that detects hand and identify 14 landmarks on the hand. I have used specific landmarks by using openCV and autopy library of python to control the mouse movements and click by hand gestures. 


<h3>Steps:</h3></br>

1.Create a Hand Detection Module that detects hand and draw 14 landmarks on the hand using openCV.</br>
2.Create a AIVirtualMouse.py file that will call Hand Detection Module and auto library of python to control the mouse movements and clicks by hand gestures.</br>
